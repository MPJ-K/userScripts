# userScripts
This repository stores user scripts I have worked on for the Tampermonkey browser extension.  
Detailed information about each script is usually included in the file itself. Feel free to try out my scripts.

# Brief script descriptions
## YouTube Custom Playback Speed Buttons
Adds easily accessible and user configurable playback speed buttons to the YouTube player's bottom menu bar.
Playback speed can be set much faster than YouTube's maximum of 2x.
The script also provides a button to remember the playback speed (playlists can be individually excluded from this).
A few other optional features are also available, see the script itself for more details.

## Redirect YouTube Shorts
A simple script that automatically redirects any YouTube Shorts video to a regular 'watch' page.  
In other words, it makes all YouTube Shorts content play in the normal YouTube video player.
