# userScripts
This repository stores user scripts I have worked on for the Tampermonkey browser extension.  
Detailed information about each script is usually included in the file itself. Feel free to try out my scripts.

# Brief script descriptions
## YouTube Custom Playback Speed Buttons
Adds easily accessible and user configurable playback speed buttons to the YouTube player's bottom menu bar.
Playback speed can be set much faster than YouTube's maximum of 2x.
The script also provides a button to remember the playback speed (playlists can be individually excluded from this).
A few other optional features are also available, see the script itself for more details.

## Redirect YouTube Shorts
A simple script that automatically redirects any YouTube Shorts video to a regular 'watch' page.  
In other words, it makes all YouTube Shorts content play in the normal YouTube video player.

## YouTube Auto Hide Live Chat
This script will automatically hide YouTube Live Chat if it is present on a video or stream.  
Live Chat can still be shown manually, this script will only try to hide it once when a watch page loads.  
As to why you would want to hide the YouTube Live Chat, it negatively impacts page performance.
While it is open, Live Chat can more than double the CPU usage of the page.
It also causes the page's RAM usage to slowly increase over time.  
Consider using this script if you only rarely interact with the YouTube Live Chat.

## Videocollege Scrollable Playback Speed Button
This script is useless for non-TU/e students.  
Modifies the playback speed button on TU/e's VOD site.
The button can be scrolled over to adjust playback speed and supports the full range of HTML5 playback speeds.
